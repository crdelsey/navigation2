|LPN|
#####

|PN| is the control system that enables a robot to
autonomously reach a goal state, such as a specific position and orientation
relative to a specific map. Given a current pose, a map, and a goal, such as a
destination pose, the navigation system generates a plan to reach the goal, and
outputs commands to autonomously drive the robot, respecting any safety
constraints and avoiding obstacles encountered along the way.
